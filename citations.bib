Giants are the main tracers and are used to characterized the large scale structures in the outer disc and in the inner regions. The warp has been found to be asymmetric and weaker than the HI warp. In the central region, the dust lanes associated with the bar have been detected, characterized and compared with the dust lanes in CO. The nuclear bar is also detected. An improved model of the bulge/bar has been established and the discovery of an in-plane overdensity which could be interpreted as either a second long thin bar, or a merger residual.},

abstract = {In recent years the stellar populations of the Milky Way have been investigated from large scale surveys in different ways, from pure star count analysis to detailed studies based on spectroscopic surveys. While in the former case the data can constrain the scale height and scale length thanks to completeness, they suffer from high correlation between these two values. On the other hand, spectroscopic surveys suffer from complex selection functions which hardly allow to derive accurate density distributions. The scale length in particular has been difficult to be constrained, resulting in discrepant values in the literature. Here, we investigate the thick disc characteristics by comparing model simulations with large scale data sets. The simulations are done from the population synthesis model of Besan{\c{c}}on. We explore the parameters of the thick disc (shape, local density, age, metallicity) using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain the model free parameters (Robin et al. 2014). Correlations between parameters are limited due to the vast spatial coverage of the used surveys (SDSS + 2MASS). We show that the thick disc was created during a long phase of formation, starting about 12 Gyr ago and finishing about 10 Gyr ago, during which gravitational contraction occurred, both vertically and radially. Moreover, in its early phase the thick disc was flaring in the outskirts. We conclude that the thick disc has been created prior to the thin disc during a gravitational collapse phase, slowed down by turbulence related to a high star formation rate, as explained for example in Bournaud et al. (2009) or Lehnert et al. (2009). Our result does not favor a formation from an initial thin disc thickened later by merger events or by secular evolution of the thin disc. We then study the in-plane distribution of stars in the thin disc from 2MASS and show that the thin disc scale length varies as a function of age, indicating an inside out formation. Moreover, we investigate the warp and flare and demonstrate that the warp amplitude is changing with time and the node angle is slightly precessing. Finally, we show comparisons between the new model and spectroscopic surveys. The new model allows to correctly simulate the kinematics, the metallicity, and $\alpha$-abundance distributions in the solar neighbourhood as well as in the bulge region.},

abstract = {Context. This study has been developed in the framework of the computational simulations executed for the preparation of the ESA Gaia astrometric mission. Aims. We focus on describing the objects and characteristics that Gaia will potentially observe without taking into consideration instrumental effects (detection efficiency, observing errors). Methods. The theoretical Universe Model prepared for the Gaia simulation has been statistically analyzed at a given time. Ingredients of the model are described, giving most attention to the stellar content, the double and multiple stars, and variability. Results. In this simulation the errors have not been included yet. Hence we estimate the number of objects and their theoretical photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic characteristics in the case that they are perfectly detected. We show that Gaia will be able to potentially observe 1.1 billion of stars (single or part of multiple star systems) of which about 2{\%} are variable stars, 3{\%} have one or two exoplanets. At the extragalactic level, observations will be potentially composed by several millions of galaxies, half million to 1 million of quasars and about 50,000 supernovas that will occur during the 5 years of mission. The simulated catalogue will be made publicly available by the DPAC on the Gaia portal of the ESA web site http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia/.},

abstract = {The K2 Mission uses the Kepler spacecraft to obtain high-precision photometry over {\~{}}80 day campaigns in the ecliptic plane. The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC) provides coordinates, photometry and kinematics based on a federation of all-sky catalogs to support target selection and target management for the K2 mission. We describe the construction of the EPIC, as well as modifications and shortcomings of the catalog. Kepler magnitudes (Kp) are shown to be accurate to {\~{}}0.1 mag for the Kepler field, and the EPIC is typically complete to Kp{\~{}}17 (Kp{\~{}}19 for campaigns covered by SDSS). We furthermore classify 138,600 targets in Campaigns 1-8 ({\~{}}88{\%} of the full target sample) using colors, proper motions, spectroscopy, parallaxes, and galactic population synthesis models, with typical uncertainties for G-type stars of {\~{}}3{\%} in Teff, {\~{}}0.3 dex in log(g), {\~{}}40{\%} in radius, {\~{}}10{\%} in mass, and {\~{}}40{\%} in distance. Our results show that stars targeted by K2 are dominated by K-M dwarfs ({\~{}}41{\%} of all selected targets), F-G dwarfs ({\~{}}36{\%}) and K giants ({\~{}}21{\%}), consistent with key K2 science programs to search for transiting exoplanets and galactic archeology studies using oscillating red giants. However, we find a significant variation of the fraction of cool dwarfs with galactic latitude, indicating a target selection bias due to interstellar reddening and the increased contamination by giant stars near the galactic plane. We discuss possible systematic errors in the derived stellar properties, and differences to published classifications for K2 exoplanet host stars. The EPIC is hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST): http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

abstract = {We estimate the stellar parameters of late K- and early M-type Kepler target stars. We obtain medium-resolution visible spectra of 382 stars with KP - J {\textgreater} 2 (≃K5 and later spectral type). We determine luminosity class by comparing the strength of gravity-sensitive indices (CaH, K I, Ca II, and Na I) to their strength in a sample of stars of known luminosity class. We find that giants constitute 96{\%} ± 1{\%} of the bright (K P {\textless} 14) Kepler target stars, and 7{\%} ± 3{\%} of dim (K P {\textgreater} 14) stars, significantly higher than fractions based on the stellar parameters quoted in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC effective temperatures are systematically (110+15- 35K) higher than temperatures we determine from fitting our spectra to PHOENIX stellar models. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the Kepler exoplanet candidate population, we find a planet occurrence of 0.36 ± 0.08 when giant stars are properly removed, somewhat higher than when a KIC log g {\textgreater} 4 criterion is used (0.27 ± 0.05). Last, we show that there is no significant difference in g - r color (a probe of metallicity) between late-type Kepler stars with transiting Earth-to-Neptune-size exoplanet candidates and dwarf stars with no detected transits. We show that a previous claimed offset between these two populations is most likely an artifact of including a large number of misidentified giants. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) contains astrometric results for more than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its operational phase. Aims. We give a brief overview of the astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions, data processing, and validation of the results. Methods. For stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only their positions are obtained, essentially by neglecting their proper motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with external data. Results. For about two million of the brighter stars (down to magnitude ∼11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars, systematic errors depending for example on position and colour are at a level of ± 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to ∼10 mas. Positions and proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas yr-1. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas yr-1. Conclusions. Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what is expected for the final mission products. The present results nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.},

abstract = {An important property of exoplanetary systems is the extent of the Habitable Zone (HZ), defined as that region where water can exist in a liquid state on the surface of a planet with sufficient atmospheric pressure. Both ground- and space-based observations have revealed a plethora of confirmed exoplanets and exoplanetary candidates, most notably from the Kepler mission using the transit detection technique. Many of these detected planets lie within the predicted HZ of their host star. However, as is the case with the derived properties of the planets themselves, the HZ boundaries depend on how well we understand the host star. Here we quantify the uncertainties of HZ boundaries on the parameter uncertainties of the host star. We examine the distribution of stellar parameter uncertainties from confirmed exoplanet hosts and Kepler candidate hosts and translate these into HZ boundary uncertainties. We apply this to several known systems with an HZ planet to determine the uncertainty in their HZ status. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We present revised properties for 196,468 stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission and used in the analysis of Quarter 1-16 (Q1-Q16) data to detect and characterize transiting planets. The catalog is based on a compilation of literature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry, spectroscopy, asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were then homogeneously fitted to a grid of Dartmouth stellar isochrones. We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report the detection of oscillations in 2762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by 20{\%} to a total of 15,500 stars. Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are 40{\%} and 20{\%}, respectively, for stars with photometric constraints only, and 5{\%}-15{\%} and 10{\%} for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison with the Q1-Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii of M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs decrease or increase depending on the Q1-Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei-Yale isochrones). Radii of F-G dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identified giants. The Q1-Q16 star properties catalog is a first step toward an improved characterization of all Kepler targets to support planet-occurrence studies. {\textcopyright} 2014.

We determine the distances to the stars and find that most lie within the thin disk of the Galaxy. Using Kepler light curves of the sample, we examine their variability on ``transit" time scales (6-12 hr) and conclude that, to date, there is a strong bias whereby Kepler discovered small planets are only found orbiting the photometrically quietest stars. Additionally, we show that there appears to be no relationship between the quietest stars and their spectral type or luminosity class and subgiants showing RV jitter can be photometrically quiet.},

abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.},

abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. Aims. A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Methods. The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. Results. Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of ∼3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr-1 for the proper motions. A systematic component of ∼0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ∼94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr-1. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is ∼10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ∼0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Conclusions. Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and 17,000 giants, and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M. Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public dataset (30 minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25{\%} for the entire sample, but can reach 100{\%} for the brightest groups of stars in the sample. G-dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of {\$}\backslashsigma \backslashsim 0.04{\$} mmag. At the precision of Kepler, {\$}{\textgreater}95{\$}{\%} of the giant stars are variable with a noise floor of {\$}\backslashsim 0.1{\$} mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for the G-giants, K-giants, and M-giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically-derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K-giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of dataset baseline (1 - 33 days), at the native 30-minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the dataset baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days, in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M-dwarf, K-dwarf, G-dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F-dwarf and A-dwarf stars as the time-baseline is increased, indicating that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of weeks whi...astroph will not allow longer abstract!},

abstract = {The Kepler mission was designed to determine the frequency of Earth-sized planets in and near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The habitable zone is the region where planetary temperatures are suitable for water to exist on a planet's surface. During the first 6 weeks of observations, Kepler monitored 156,000 stars, and five new exoplanets with sizes between 0.37 and 1.6 Jupiter radii and orbital periods from 3.2 to 4.9 days were discovered. The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher. Kepler-7b is one of the lowest-density planets (∼0.17 gram per cubic centimeter) yet detected. Kepler-5b, -6b, and -8b confirm the existence of planets with densities lower than those predicted for gas giant planets.},

abstract = {Surface gravity is a basic stellar property, but it is difficult to measure accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25 to 50 per cent if measured spectroscopically and 90 to 150 per cent if measured photometrically. Asteroseismology measures gravity with an uncertainty of about 2 per cent but is restricted to relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants. The availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for more than 150,000 stars provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity: if brightness variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variations should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and root mean squared brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours for stars with temperatures of 4,500 to 6,750 kelvin, log surface gravities of 2.5 to 4.5 (cgs units) and overall brightness variations of less than three parts per thousand. A straightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows a determination of the surface gravity with a precision of better than 25 per cent for inactive Sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant stages of evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
