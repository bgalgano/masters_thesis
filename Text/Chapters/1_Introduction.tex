The TESS mission will survey the entire sky for the nearest, brightest stars with transiting exoplanets \citep{Ricker2015,Sullivan2015}.  As we have learned from the Kepler mission, the reliability of estimated exoplanet radii is impacted by the precision of the stellar parameters \citep{Plavchan14,Kane14,Howell14,Bastien14,Mann12}. In particular, sub-giants can masquerade as main-sequence stars in the absence of an ancillary determination of the stellar distance, leading to the underestimation of exoplanet radii. GAIA  provided the distances to the nearest $\sim$1 billion stars, enabling the accurate determination of those stellar radii \citep{Prusti2016,Brown2016,Lindegren2016,Stassun2016}. 

In the absence of a stellar parallax, several tools exist to determine the surface gravity of stars.  Flicker and asteroseismology require high precision photometry, which won't be available until after the launch of the TESS mission \citep{Bastien2013,Bastien2016}. Prior to launch, obtaining high resolution spectroscopy in a short time-frame is not practical for hundreds of thousands of stars dispersed across the sky.  Thus, the combination of broad-band photometry and reduced proper-motions as a proxy for distance are utilized to identify main sequence stars \citep{Bastien2016,Huber2014,Lepine2011,Brown2011,Gould2003}. 2MASS revealed that photometric colors alone can sometimes be used as a proxy for the surface gravity of M stars, where M dwarfs and giants occupy slightly different tracks in $J-H$ vs. $H-K_s$ \citep{Ciardi2011,Plavchan2008,Plavchan2006,Skrutskie2006}.  It is not known whether this difference is attributable to extinction or gravity-sensitive spectral features in the J-band.  

In this paper, we investigate whether colors from the 2MASS and WISE photometric catalogs can provide additional surface gravity information extending the separation for M stars with 2MASS into the mid-infrared. In \autoref{chap:DATA}, we present our sample of stars. We use the Michigan Spectral Atlases for a compilation of spectroscopically determined spectral types and luminosity classes, which we compare to 2MASS and WISE colors \citep{Houk1982,Houk1988,Houk1999}.  In \autoref{chap:METHODS} we present our analysis to determine color relationships as a function of spectral type and luminosity class.  In \autoref{chap:RESULTS}, we present our color table results and the identification of a new color separation between dwarfs and giants.  In \autoref{chap:DISCUSSION}, we discuss the prospects of color selection for surface gravity and highlight a case study of assigning a probabilistic luminosity class in Section [galactic  model].  In \autoref{chap:CONCLUSION} we present our conclusions and suggestions for future improvement in luminosity class determination.
