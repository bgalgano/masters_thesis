\chapter{Spectral and photometric catalogs}\label{Appendix:1}
This appendix showcases the number of stars from binning by both luminosity and spectral classes. There are \bincount stars for which we have all 2MASS/WISE photometric data and spectral/luminosity information from the Michigan Spectral Altases available. The scarcity of stars in some bins limits the range of classes for which we can calculate average or median color (see Chapter \ref{chap:3}).
