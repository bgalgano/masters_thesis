\chapter{Color medians and standard deviations}\label{Appendix:2}
This appendix is a set of 21 tables that list the calculated median and robust standard deviation of all colors from the 2MASS/WISE photometric catalogs \citep{2MASS,ALLWISE}. Spectral and luminosity class information was obtained by cross-matching to the Michigan Spectral Atlases \citep{Houk1975,Houk1978,Houk1982,Houk1988,Houk1999}, which resulted in a sample of $\sim$20,000 stars (Chapter \ref{sec:cross-matching}). The number of stars for each luminosity class ($I$, $II$, $III$, $IV$, and $IV$) and spectral sub-type is also listed. Due to the relatively small sample size, some bins may be empty or have fewer than 2 stars, so these color statistics could not be calculated, and are denoted by ``...''. Robust standard deviation was calculated as opposed to normal standard deviation in light of these small-sized spectral sub-type and luminosity class bins. For the specific number of stars in each bin, see Table \ref{table:bin_counts}. For more information on how these color statistics were calculated, see Chapter \ref{subsec:median_stats}.
