\chapter{Color probability distributions}\label{Appendix:3}
We present average colors $J-W_{1}$ and $J-W_{2}$, for which we found a significant difference among dwarf and giant stars of the same spectral type (G0--K3) We also present the probability ratios, or the likelihood, of a star being a dwarf or a giant as a function of \jwone and \jwtwo color and spectral subtype. See Chapter 2 for more detail on how these color probabilities were calculated, and Chapter 3 for discussion of results.
